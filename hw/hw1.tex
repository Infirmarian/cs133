\subsubsection*{1. Find out the number of cores of the processors in your cell phone and laptop/desktop.
Specify their types, if known.}
In my laptop (MacBook Pro, early 2015), there are \textbf{2 cores} in an Intel i5 processor. In my phone
(iPhone 8) there is an A11 processor with \textbf{6 cores}, two of which are more powerful cores and four
that are more energy efficient

\subsubsection*{2. What is Dennard Scaling? What caused its breakdown?}
Dennard Scaling is the reduction of transistor dimensions by 30\% every two years. This has the benefit of
reducing transistor area by about 50\%, as well as reducing delay, power and energy. Smaller transistors
also allow for deeper pipelines and better instruction level parallelism. Dennard Scaling broke down due
to voltage leakage, where the threshold of voltage was so low that electrons would leak across the transistor.
This means that voltage cannot continue to scale down with the rest of the chip, and therefore more power
must be used for higher frequencies, increasing temperatures to unacceptable levels

\subsubsection*{3. Please compute the power efficiency of the Top-10 supercomputers announced in
Nov. 2019, and list the top-3 most power efficient supercomputers. Please use the
measurement in terms of Rmax/Power (you can compute only those whose Power
numbers are available).}

\subsubsection*{4. Given an integer array a[ ] of N elements. Please write an OpenMP function to sort it
by the Quicksort algorithm using the task directive. The function header is: void
quicksort(int *a, int p, int r). (p represents the start index and r
represents the end index)}
